                        Muhammad Kutty Panaparambil Ismail (Malayalam
                        pronunciation: ​[muhɐmːɐd̪ kuʈːi pɐnɐpːɐrɐmbil ismɐjl];
                        born 7 September 1951), known mononymously by the
                        hypocorism Mammootty (IPA: [mɐmːuːʈːi]), is an Indian
                        actor and film producer who works predominantly in
                        Malayalam films. He has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu,
                        Kannada, Hindi, and English-language productions. In a
                        career spanning five decades, he has acted in over 400
                        films. He is the recipient of several accolades,
                        including three National Film Awards, seven Kerala State
                        Film Awards, and thirteen Filmfare Awards South. For his
                        contribution to film, the Government of India awarded
                        him the Padma Shri in 1998. In 2022, he was honoured
                        with Kerala Prabha Award, the second-highest honour
                        given by the Government of Kerala. Mammootty made his
                        debut in acting through Malayalam film Anubhavangal
                        Paalichakal in 1971. His first leading role was in I. V.
                        Sasi's unreleased film Devalokam (1979). Mammootty's
                        breakthrough came in 1981 when he received the Kerala
                        State Film Award for Second Best Actor for his
                        performance in Ahimsa. Major commercial successes during
                        this time included the 1983 films Sandhyakku Virinja
                        Poovu and Aa Raathri. Following a series of box office
                        failures, the 1987 crime thriller New Delhi improved his
                        commercial prospects. The films that followed through
                        the next decade established Mammootty as one of the
                        leading stars of Malayalam cinema. The 2000s were a
                        period of critical and commercial success for Mammootty.
                        His performance in the Hindi and English-language
                        bilingual biopic Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (2000) won him
                        the National Film Award for Best Actor, and he won
                        Kerala State Film Awards for Kaazcha (2004) and Paleri
                        Manikyam (2009). He garnered further critical praise for
                        the satire Pranchiyettan & the Saint (2010), drama
                        Varsham (2014), period drama Pathemari and black comedy
                        Unda (2019), and received Filmfare Awards for Best Actor
                        for the first three. His highest-grossing releases
                        include the period action Mamangam and Madhura Raja in
                        2019, and the action thriller Bheeshma Parvam in 2022.
                        Mammootty is the chairman of Malayalam Communications,
                        which runs the Malayalam television channels Kairali TV,
                        Kairali News and Kairali We. He is the owner of multiple
                        production ventures, including the
                        distribution-production banner Playhouse and the
                        Mammootty Kampany.
